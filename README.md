# pythonLoginProject
### Feature - 2- Monisha
* I have created a registration page followed by login page.
* While registering there are three checks which was performed:
    - to check if it is a email
    - to check if it is not a duplicate email/ username.
    - to check if it is a valid existing email - (Email Verification)- For this we have used the QuickMailVerification API
 * Afer logging in you can send a mail from registered mail address to anyone.
 * Here I have used the SendGrid API to send mail to the recepients.
